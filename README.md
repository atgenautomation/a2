# Atgen A2 Automation
Atgen A2 is a radically simple IT automation solution that automates application builds, continuous testing, data parsing &amp; processing, report generation, batch processing, job scheduling, and many other IT needs. Avoid running repetitive batch jobs and managing access to deploy and update your applications â€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH or WinRM, with no agents to install on remote systems. http://www.atgensoft.com/

# Design Principles
  - Have a dead simple setup process and a minimal learning curve.
  - Manage machines very quickly and in parallel.
  - Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by leveraging the existing SSH or WinRM daemon.
  - Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human friendly.
  - Focus on security and easy auditability.
  - Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any software.
  - Be usable as non-root.
  - Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.
