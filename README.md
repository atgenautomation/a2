# a2
Atgen A2 is a radically simple IT automation solution that automates application builds, continuous testing, data parsing &amp; processing, report generation, batch processing, job scheduling, and many other IT needs. Avoid running repetitive batch jobs and managing access to deploy and update your applications â€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH or WinRM, with no agents to install on remote systems. http://www.atgensoft.com/
